# Trading Tool - AI Interpretation

This repository contains a hybrid crypto trading application combining Python and Solidity. The AI interpretation of the project is as follows:

### Components
1. **Python Backend**:
   - Handles blockchain connectivity and API interactions.
   - Uses Web3 for Binance Smart Chain RPC connections.
   - Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices via Binance API.

2. **Solidity Smart Contract**:
   - Implements a decentralized trading system.
   - Allows users to open leveraged positions.
   - Tracks positions on-chain using a mapping.

### Purpose
The project aims to provide a foundation for building a decentralized crypto trading platform. It combines off-chain logic (Python) with on-chain functionality (Solidity).

### Suggested Enhancements
- Add functionality to close positions in the smart contract.
- Integrate Python with the deployed smart contract for seamless interaction.
- Implement unit tests for both Python and Solidity components.

### Notes for AI
This file is intended for AI-based interpretation and suggestions. It may not fully align with the actual implementation but provides a high-level overview for further development.
