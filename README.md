This project is a cryptocurrency trading tool that integrates with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Binance API. It includes:

- **Python Backend**:
  - Connects to the Binance Smart Chain using Web3.
  - Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices from Binance's REST API.
- **Solidity Smart Contract**:
  - Allows users to open leveraged trading positions.
  - Tracks positions using a mapping of addresses to position details.

### Features
1. **BNBChainConnector**:
   - Establishes a connection to the Binance Smart Chain RPC.
   - Verifies connectivity to the blockchain.

2. **BinanceAPI**:
   - Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices (e.g., BNB/USDT).

3. **CryptoTradingApp Smart Contract**:
   - Enables users to open leveraged trading positions.
   - Stores and retrieves trading positions on-chain.
